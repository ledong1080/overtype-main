## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-21

### Added
- **View Modes** - Three distinct editing/viewing modes accessible via toolbar dropdown
  - Normal Edit Mode: Default WYSIWYG markdown editing with syntax highlighting
  - Plain Textarea Mode: Shows raw markdown without preview overlay  
  - Preview Mode: Read-only rendered preview with proper typography and clickable links
- **API Methods for HTML Export**
  - `getRenderedHTML(processForPreview)`: Get rendered HTML of current content
  - `getPreviewHTML()`: Get the exact HTML displayed in preview layer
  - Enables external preview generation and HTML export functionality
- **View Mode API Methods**
  - `showPlainTextarea(boolean)`: Programmatically switch to/from plain textarea mode
  - `showPreviewMode(boolean)`: Programmatically switch to/from preview mode
- **Enhanced Link Handling**
  - Links now always have real hrefs (pointer-events controls clickability)
  - Links properly hidden in preview mode (no more visible `](url)` syntax)
  - Simplified implementation without dynamic href updates
- **CSS Isolation Improvements**
  - Middle-ground CSS reset prevents parent styles from leaking into editor
  - Protects against inherited margins, padding, borders, and decorative styles
  - Maintains proper inheritance for fonts and colors
- **Dropdown Menu System**
  - Fixed positioning dropdown menus that work with scrollable toolbar
  - Dropdown appends to document.body to avoid overflow clipping
  - Proper z-index management for reliable visibility
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**
  - Added tests for preview mode functionality
  - Added tests for link parsing and XSS prevention
  - Added tests for new API methods (getValue, getRenderedHTML, getPreviewHTML)
  - Test coverage includes view mode switching, HTML rendering, and post-processing

### Fixed
- **Preview Mode Link Rendering** - URL syntax parts now properly hidden in preview mode
- **Code Block Backgrounds** - Restored pale yellow background in normal mode
- **Dropdown Menu Positioning** - Fixed dropdown being cut off by toolbar overflow
- **Cave Theme Styling**
  - Eye icon button now has proper contrast when active (dropdown-active state)
  - Code blocks in preview mode use appropriate dark background (#11171F)
- **Toolbar Scrolling** - Toolbar now scrolls horizontally on all screen sizes as intended
- **CSS Conflicts** - Parent page styles no longer interfere with editor styling

### Changed
- Link implementation simplified - always uses real hrefs with CSS controlling interaction
- Post-processing for lists and code blocks now works in both browser and Node.js environments
- Toolbar overflow changed from hidden to auto for horizontal scrolling
- Dropdown menus use fixed positioning instead of absolute
- **Removed `overscroll-behavior: none`** to restore scroll-through behavior
  - Users can now continue scrolling the parent page when reaching editor boundaries
  - Trade-off: Minor visual desync during Safari elastic bounce vs trapped scrolling

## [1.1.8] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- Android bold/italic rendering regression from v1.1.3
  - Removed `font-synthesis: none` to restore synthetic bold/italic on Android devices
  - Updated font stack to avoid 'ui-monospace' pitfalls while maintaining Android support
  - Font stack now properly includes: SF Mono, Roboto Mono, Noto Sans Mono, Droid Sans Mono
  - Fixes issue where Android users could not see bold or italic text formatting

## [1.1.7] - 2025-01-20

### Security
- Fixed XSS vulnerability where javascript: protocol links could execute arbitrary code (#25)
  - Added URL sanitization to block dangerous protocols (javascript:, data:, vbscript:, etc.)
  - Safe protocols allowed: http://, https://, mailto:, ftp://, ftps://
  - Relative URLs and hash links continue to work normally
  - Dangerous URLs are neutralized to "#" preventing code execution

## [1.1.6] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- URLs with markdown characters (underscores, asterisks) no longer break HTML structure (#23)
  - Implemented "URL Sanctuary" pattern to protect link URLs from markdown processing
  - Links are now treated as protected zones where markdown syntax is literal text
  - Fixes malformed HTML when URLs contain `_`, `__`, `*`, `**` characters
  - Preserves proper href attributes and visual rendering

## [1.1.5] - 2025-01-20

### Added
- TypeScript definitions file (`src/overtype.d.ts`) with complete type definitions (#20)
- TypeScript test file (`test-types.ts`) for type validation

### Fixed
- Text selection desynchronization during overscroll on browsers with elastic scrolling (#17)
  - Added `overscroll-behavior: none` to prevent bounce animation at scroll boundaries
  - Ensures text selection stays synchronized between textarea and preview layers

## [1.1.4] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- Code blocks no longer render markdown formatting - `__init__` displays correctly (#14)
  - Post-processing strips all formatting from lines inside code blocks
  - Preserves plain text display for asterisks, underscores, backticks, etc.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- Inline triple backticks no longer mistaken for code blocks (#15)
  - Code fences now only recognized when alone on a line or followed by language identifier
  - Prevents cascade failures where inline backticks break subsequent code blocks
- Android cursor misalignment on bold text (#16)
  - Updated font stack to avoid problematic `ui-monospace` on Android
  - Added explicit Android fonts: Roboto Mono, Noto Sans Mono, Droid Sans Mono
  - Added `font-synthesis: none` and `font-variant-ligatures: none` to prevent width drift

## [1.1.2] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- `textareaProps` option to pass native HTML attributes to textarea (required, maxLength, name, etc.) (#8)
- `autoResize` option for auto-expanding editor height based on content
- `minHeight` and `maxHeight` options for controlling auto-resize bounds
- Form integration example in README showing how to use with HTML form validation

### Fixed
- Height issue when toolbar and stats bar are enabled - container now uses CSS Grid properly (#9)
- Grid layout issue where editors without toolbars would collapse to min-height
- Added explicit grid-row positions for toolbar, wrapper, and stats elements
- Stats bar now positioned at bottom of container using grid (not absolute positioning)

### Changed
- Container uses CSS Grid layout (`grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto`) for proper height distribution
- Toolbar takes auto height, editor wrapper takes remaining space (1fr), stats bar takes auto height
- Bundle size: 60.89 KB minified (16.8 KB gzipped)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-18

- Added "SEE ALL DEMOS" button to index.html

### Fixed
- Link tooltip positioning now accurate relative to rendered text

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-18

- Tab key no longer causes focus loss and cursor misalignment (#3)

### Changed
